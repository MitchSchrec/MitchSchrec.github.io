        <p>The Paradise Law Office is a general practice law office that focuses on customer service by providing high
            quality legal representation at a price its clients can afford. Unlike many law firms, the Paradise Law
            Office does not bill by the hour, but instead charges under a "flat fee" system or percentage basis so that
            its clients always know ahead of time how much something will cost so they don't have to worry about being
            billed for every phone call, email or meeting.</p>
        <p>When you hire the Paradise Law Office you will always work directly with an attorney and not a paralegal or
            assistant. The Paradise Law Office understands that you want quick, accessible and easy to understand
            answers to your legal questions and that’s why phone calls and emails made during regular business hours are
            generally returned on the same day. In addition, Mr. Paradise is willing to hold non-traditional work hours
            by meeting with clients in the evening and weekends.</p>
        <p>The Paradise Law Office firmly believes that the legal situation for each client is unique and deserves
            specific attention. That is why Mr. Paradise will take the time to meet with you personally to become
            familiar with not only your particular legal issue, but also with your individual circumstances and
            background. The Paradise Law Office wants its clients to feel comfortable before entering into a formal
            relationship and is willing to meet with anyone for a free, one hour, no obligation consultation to discuss
            their legal needs and concerns.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-uppercase">Last Will And Testament</h2>
                            <p>If you have children, own a home or have anything of value, you need a Will. Yet
                                according to polls done by Forbes Magazine & USA TODAY only 35% of Americans have a
                                Will. Your Will explains in writing what you want to have happen to your assets when you
                                pass away. It helps determine such things as who receives your property and other
                                belongings, who you want to raise your children, who you want to be responsible for
                                managing money left to your under-age children, where you want to be buried and much
                                more.</p>
                            <h3>Every Will should deal with the following:</h3>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>Who will serve as your executor? Your “executor” is the person (or persons) who are
                                    responsible for making sure that your Will is properly administered in Surrogate
                                    Court and that your assets are given to who you named. An executor can be almost
                                    anyone you want – your spouse, a friend, your lawyer or even a bank. It is important
                                    that you choose someone you trust, who will follow through with your wishes and who
                                    can handle and work through any disputes that may come up among your loved ones and
                                    other beneficiaries. In addition to the original executor, you will need to name a
                                    successor executor in case your first choice can’t serve for any reason.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Who gets specific items? For example, many women wish to give their engagement ring
                                    to their daughter and many men wish to give their tools, guns or sports memorabilia
                                    to their son. If you don’t specifically put in writing that someone is to receive
                                    your English China, then it becomes part of the “residual estate” and that person
                                    may or may not receive it. Furthermore, if you know that your children are going to
                                    fight over a family heirloom or something that is one of a kind or you promised
                                    something specific to someone, then it should be written into your Will. (Many
                                    estate fights are over sentimental things or family heirlooms as opposed to money.)
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Do you wish to make any specific cash distributions? For example, do you want to
                                    give specific amounts to your grandkids or leave a donation to your favorite charity
                                    or church? When it comes to specific cash bequests, it is important to note that
                                    they will only be made if the money is actually available. For example, if you leave
                                    $100,000 to someone and you don’t have $100,000 that will be a problem. Therefore,
                                    it’s critical to make sure that any amounts you specify are realistic and are likely
                                    to be in existence when you pass away. Furthermore, if you specifically give a cash
                                    bequest, then it will likely be paid out first before other bequests, which can
                                    cause problems if the amount of the cash bequest represents a significant portion of
                                    your estate assets.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>
                                    Who gets your “residual” estate? That is everything that is left over and not
                                    specifically mentioned in the Will. This is often done on a percentage basis. For
                                    example, if you have three children, you could state that they would each get
                                    one-third of your estate. Or for many people, they state that “I leave everything to
                                    my spouse” often called a “Sweet-Heart” Will. However, if you do this, you need to
                                    state what happens if your spouse pre-deceases you or dies in the same car accident
                                    or plane crash. For example, you might leave everything to your spouse, but if he
                                    pre-deceases you then to your children in equal shares. It will then be up to your
                                    executor to decide how best to handle the eventual distribution of your residuary
                                    estate. In many cases, people will go through personal belongings and take turns
                                    picking out what they want. Things like stocks or cash can be divided more easily,
                                    while real estate will usually be sold and the proceeds divided.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>You will also want to think about what happens in the unfortunate event that someone
                                    named in your will pre-deceases you. Should their share go to their children or
                                    should it be split only among the survivors of those you specifically named?
                                    Unquestionably, people want to be fair to their children and loved ones when it
                                    comes to their estate, but as the saying goes “fair isn’t always equal and equal
                                    isn’t always fair.” There are many circumstances where it is completely appropriate
                                    to give one child more than another. For example, if a local child is a primary
                                    care-giver and other children are located out of town. Other common situations
                                    include when one child has already received significant financial assistance or
                                    there is a wide financial discrepancy in the personal lives of your children.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Who will raise your children and look after their finances? If you have under-age
                                    children (below the age of 18), you will want to mention in your Will who you would
                                    like to see raise them and who should manage their money. The person you name will
                                    likely become the legal guardian who will be responsible for raising your children,
                                    therefore you want to make sure you not only pick someone you trust, but is also
                                    willing to accept the job. I say “likely” because the court is always going to do
                                    what is in the “best interests of the child” so if the person you name turns out to
                                    be irresponsible, then the court wouldn’t neccesarily follow your wishes – but there
                                    has to be a very good reason for the court to do this.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>If your children are under 18 years of age, any money they receive can be placed “in
                                    trust” until they turn 18 or some later age you list in the Will. In many cases,
                                    people are afraid that their kids would blow through the money if they were given it
                                    all at age 18, so they put restrictions in their Will. For example, their children
                                    might receive a third of their inheritance at 18, another third at 21 or 25 and the
                                    rest at age 30. The trustee would have the authority to provide money to the child
                                    earlier if needed for such things as education, medical expenses or perhaps a major
                                    life event like a wedding. The guardian and trustee can be the same person or
                                    different people if you want a separation of powers and oversight.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>While a Will can determine how almost all of your assets are handled, it is
                                    important to know that under federal law certain items will not be controlled by
                                    your Will such as life insurance, certain bank accounts and many individual
                                    retirement accounts such as IRA’s and 401Ks. Only if you list your estate as the
                                    “beneficiary” on the forms controlling these accounts will your Will handle these
                                    accounts. However, if you do name someone specifically on the beneficiary form, then
                                    that form will legally control who gets that asset and not your Will. Therefore, it
                                    is important that you regularly review and update these forms to make sure that they
                                    properly express your wishes.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Many people want to know how much a Will costs? In many cases it can be done for
                                    just a couple hundred dollars. However, there are many factors that could make it
                                    more complex and costly such as children with special needs, adopted or out of
                                    wedlock children, divorces and of course tax planning issues if you are fortunate
                                    enough to have assets greater than two million dollars. The estate tax currently
                                    doesn’t kick in until you have at least two million dollars for New York State (the
                                    top tax rate is 16%) and over five million dollars at the federal level (the top tax
                                    rate is 40%). Truth be told, the estate tax is something people fear, but in reality
                                    affects very few. According to the Wall Street Journal it is estimated that less
                                    than 4,000 estates across the United States will owe federal estate taxes in 2014.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Furthermore, when thinking about estate planning, you also need to consider
                                    something that has long been overlooked – your digital assets – things such as
                                    iTunes or Snapfish photo accounts, Facebook, frequent flyer or credit card reward
                                    accounts and even blogs – which can have significant sentimental value as well as
                                    financial. The law is evolving with technology, but right now it is best that you
                                    make sure your loved ones know your passwords to such accounts, so they can easily
                                    access and transfer them upon death because some “terms of service” agreements do
                                    not allow them to be inherited. Accounts are sometimes even terminated or “locked”
                                    when a service provider is notified that the account holder has passed away.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>A final note on Wills: It is a good idea to write down and store in a safe place a
                                    full listing of all your important information and let your executor know where this
                                    list is kept. Things to be listed should include bank account information, life
                                    insurance, retirement accounts, social security benefits, veterans benefits, real
                                    estate holdings, name of your accountant for tax returns, your lawyer and so forth.
                                    This will make the job of your executor much easier. There is no central database of
                                    bank accounts, and I can’t tell you how many times people thought their parents did
                                    all their banking at one paticular bank and then the parents happened to have
                                    several other bank accounts around town. Both Erie and Niagara Surrogate Court allow
                                    for the FREE storage of Wills in their vault, which is a great service that prevents
                                    your Will from being lost, stolen or destroyed helping to ensure that your wishes
                                    will eventually be followed.

                            <h2 class="text-uppercase">But What Heppens If I Die Without A Will</h2>
                            <h6>A court would then determine how your estate is handled – which for many people is NOT
                                the way they would want. For example:</h6>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>In New York State the court will follow what is known as the “laws of intestacy”
                                    which may mean that some distant relative or someone you don’t like or trust could
                                    receive part of your estate or even be named as the guardian of your children.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Many people falsely assume that if they are married and die without a Will that
                                    everything will go to their spouse. Unfortunately, under New York State law that is
                                    not the case. Without a Will, if you have children, then your spouse is only
                                    entitled to certain monetary amounts and household items as set by law and then the
                                    rest is divided between your spouse and children. If you are divorced or have
                                    children with different partners, then this can cause numerous headaches for your
                                    loved ones and often less than desired consequences.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Without a Will, the court will appoint someone to serve as the “administrator” of
                                    your estate. This can be very costly as the person will likely have to post a surety
                                    bond and there can be court fights and challenges over who gets various items in
                                    your estate. It may seem silly, but as previously mentioned many times the fight
                                    isn’t over money, but instead over things such as who gets the Christmas ornaments
                                    or who gets mom’s engagement ring. Furthermore, the costs of an administration can
                                    be quite high when children are involved because in many cases annual reports and
                                    accountings will have to be filed with the court until your children turn 18 and
                                    court permission may be needed to pay for the things your child needs.

                            <h2 class="text-uppercase">What About Trusts?</h2>
                            <p>As the death of long-time Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson demonstrated, trusts get lots
                                of attention in the news media and by some financial planners such as Suze Orman. The
                                biggest benefits to trusts tend to be privacy and the ability to control assets “from
                                the grave” for an extended period of time. While common in some states such as
                                California, trusts are not widely used in WNY. Trusts can be much more expensive than a
                                Will to set-up and most importantly unlike a Will which can control all your assets
                                (both those you presently have as well as those you may have in the future), trusts only
                                manage those assets you specifically put into the trust, so they constantly need to be
                                updated and changed.</p>
                            <p>However, there are certain situations where trusts can be quite useful. For example, if
                                you have a loved one who has special needs or disabilities, a trust can help ensure that
                                the trust beneficiary continues to be eligible for government benefits, while also still
                                being able to receive monies from the estate to enhance his or her quality of life.</p>
                            <p>Trusts can also be useful in “blended” families (or second marriages) by ensuring that a
                                surviving spouse or partner is taken care of while alive, but at the same time ensuring
                                that children from a first marriage or other relationship later receive an inheritance.
                                There have been horror stories of unintended consequences, where someone leaves
                                everything to the other spouse and then that spouse remarries leaving everything to
                                their “new” spouse and the children see nothing. Or the last surviving spouse leaves
                                everything to his or her own children alone instead of including the step-children.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-uppercase">What Is A Life Estate?</h2>
                            <p>A life estate is often used when dealing with real estate and allows the owner to remain
                                in the property while that person is alive and as long as the taxes are paid and general
                                maintenance on the property is continued so it doesn’t fall into disrepair. Then when
                                the owner dies, those named as a beneficiary (called a “grantee” on the life estate
                                deed) inherit the property by presenting the death certificate to the county clerk. One
                                of the key benefits of a life estate is that it can possibly help protect your heirs
                                from Medicaid liens. (Given that your home is likely one of your largest assets that you
                                worked a lifetime to pay off, many people hope to be able to leave it as part of their
                                inheritance as opposed to being subject to nursing home bills.) However, the life estate
                                is currently subject to a 60 month look-back period where Medicaid can “claw-back” part
                                of the value of the home. So in order for this to work, you need to do it as part of
                                your long-range planning and when you are still healthy and the prospect of needing
                                nursing home care is slim. If you seek Medicaid assistance during the 60 month look-back
                                period, Medicaid will assume that you made the transfer solely to qualify for Medicaid
                                and it will trigger a time period of ineligibility, which can potentially have
                                devastating consequences on both the quality of care and finances.</p>
                            <p>There are significant drawbacks to a life estate, including giving up control over the
                                property as well as possible tax consequences to the beneficiaries. When you create a
                                life estate you are in essence “co-owning” the property with your named beneficiaries
                                and therefore, you will require their permission if you decide to make changes. For
                                example, if you need to take out a mortgage or home-equity loan they would also have to
                                sign off on it. Even more alarming, if one of your named beneficiaries was to get
                                divorced, since they have a future ownership in the property, the ex-spouse may be able
                                to make a claim on the property. In addition, the creditors of beneficiaries may also be
                                able to lay claim to the property if a beneficiary is sued or defaults on a loan. While
                                unlikely, these are serious risks that need to be carefully considered.</p>
                            <p>One of the most important considerations when doing a life estate is to be 100% positive
                                that you want to remain in that particular home for the rest of your life. Say you want
                                to later downsize or move to Florida, you will need those you named as beneficiaries to
                                agree to the sale – and there are times where for whatever reason they don’t want to see
                                Mom or Dad move and then it’s potentially an expensive legal battle to try to unwind the
                                life estate. Furthermore, selling a home that has a life estate can have significant tax
                                consequences for those involved. Typically the sale of a primary residence is free from
                                capital gains taxes for the first $250,000 in gain (profit) per individual or $500,000
                                for a married couple – which in WNY where property values rise at a slow and steady pace
                                makes almost all primary residences exempt from this tax. If the house is sold following
                                the death of the owner as part of an estate through a Will, then there would be a
                                stepped-up basis in valuing the property, resulting in little to no taxes due. However,
                                if the property is sold while the life estate is still in effect, then IRS actuary
                                tables (based on age and life expectancy) would determine how much of the sales price
                                goes to the person holding the life estate and how much goes to the beneficiaries. While
                                the life tenant would likely not be subject to capital gains taxes, the beneficiary
                                likely would be – and based on the difference between what the owner originally paid for
                                the property and what it sold for – which if the property has been held for a long time
                                can add up.</p>

                            <p>The health care proxy allows your agent to make health care decisions on your behalf when
                                you can’t make those decisions yourself. You can only name one person as your health
                                care proxy in order to avoid disputes – though you can name a back-up in case that
                                person isn’t available or can’t make the decision. The person you name as your health
                                care agent can only make decisions on your behalf after your attending physician and a
                                second doctor agree that you lack decision making capacity. </p>
                            <p>In its most simple, straightforward terms, a health care proxy allows someone to “pull
                                the plug” on your life. Therefore, it is critical that you pick someone to serve as your
                                health care agent that you trust and can talk to about your personal beliefs regarding
                                medical issues including life and death decisions. You want to pick someone who you know
                                will follow your wishes and beliefs and not their own.</p>
                            <p>If you find yourself in a bleak medical situation such as a horrific accident, major
                                stroke or heart attack, you need to clearly let this person know whether you want no
                                extraordinary measures to be taken to keep you alive or for the doctors to do everything
                                humanly possible to keep you alive. This is an extremely personal decision based on your
                                own personal religious and moral beliefs. Given the advances that medicine is making
                                every day, this decision cannot be made lightly. For example, this person should know if
                                you want to be “hooked up to tubes” or kept on life support or if you want to die at
                                home if possible. In addition, they should know your feelings on organ donation, which
                                can help save or improve the quality of life for someone else.</p>
                            <p>A living will goes hand in hand with your health care proxy and spells out what your
                                personal desires are regarding health care decisions. By creating a living will, you
                                will help make sure that your wishes are continued even if you can no longer communicate
                                them. It states what kinds of treatment you want or are opposed to and serves as
                                evidence of these wishes in case there is disagreement or a legal challenge. If your
                                agent doesn’t have specific knowledge of your wishes, your agent may be prevented from
                                making decisions regarding certain medical procedures. You should be as specific as
                                possible with your views, especially when it comes to such things as the administration
                                of artificial feeding – food and water – or if you authorize a “do not resuscitate”
                                order. Furthermore, what do you want to happen if you are in a terminal condition, in a
                                “vegetative” state or are conscious, but suffer irreversible brain damage? It has been
                                long accepted by the New York State courts and the US Supreme Court agrees that a
                                competent adult has the right to determine what happens to their body, which includes
                                accepting or declining medical treatment – even if it will result in death.</p>
                            <p>Without a health care proxy, a guardian might have to be appointed by a court to make
                                health care decisions. You may remember from news reports the sad and tragic case from a
                                decade ago in Florida involving Terri Schiavo and the court battle between her parents
                                and her husband on whether or not to withdraw her life support. Demonstrating that one
                                can never be too young to start thinking about estate planning and end of life
                                decisions, Ms. Schiavo was struck by her unfortunate medical condition when she was less
                                than thirty years old. You can help avoid your family going through a similar battle
                                that is both emotionally heart wrenching and expensive by creating your health care
                                proxy and living will.</p>
                            <p>Appointing an agent to handle your last remains: In New York State an individual can name
                                someone who upon their death will be responsible for handling their last remains. Under
                                the law it is clear that a surviving spouse controls the last remains of the deceased.
                                However, fighting can occur when there is no surviving spouse and surviving children (or
                                other relatives) have differing wishes. The classic example is hall of fame baseball
                                player Ted Williams whose children battled in court on whether or not have to him
                                cremated or have his body cryogenically frozen. Most people appoint their health care
                                proxy to also serve in this role and include the appointment and brief description of
                                whether they wish to be buried or cremated (and where) with the health care proxy
                                paperwork. It’s a good idea to take the time to do this because even if you include your
                                wishes concerning your last remains in your Will, it may take some time to locate your
                                Will or file it with the Surrogate Court for probate.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-uppercase">Power Of Attorney</h2>
                            <p>In New York State the standard power of attorney has been pre-crafted by the legislature,
                                though it can be amended with your specific instructions to fit your unique
                                circumstances. It is a very powerful document that allows someone else (your agent) to
                                do things on your behalf as if they were in your shoes. You can have your power of
                                attorney come into effect as soon as you sign it (known as a “durable” power of
                                attorney) or you can make it “springing” so that it only comes into effect when you are
                                incapacitated and can no longer handle your own affairs according to a doctor who has
                                been treating you.
                            </p>
                            <p>The powers available to an agent under a power of attorney can be as broad or as specific
                                as you wish. For example, you can restrict it to only banking matters or to sell your
                                house or you can have it allow the agent do estate planning, give gifts and much more.
                                You can also designate if you want the agent to be compensated for the work done on your
                                behalf or if you want someone to monitor your agent. An important change in the law was
                                created in 2009, which requires that whoever you appoint as your agent to accept the job
                                and agree to only serve in your best interest by signing the document as well. The agent
                                is also required to keep detailed records and receipts of what she does on your behalf.
                                Therefore, it is once again important that you not only pick someone who you trust, but
                                who is also willing to help you if the need arises. Just like a Will, each power of
                                attorney is unique and can be crafted according to your personal wishes.</p>
                            <p>If you do not have a power of attorney and you were to become incapacitated because you
                                suffer a stroke, are in a car accident or have Alzheimer’s, your loved ones would likely
                                have to petition the court to have someone appointed to serve as your “guardian” to
                                handle your legal affairs. This can be a very costly and time consuming process, whereas
                                this simple, yet powerful document is usually inexpensive to have created.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-uppercase">Fall 2014 Legal Update</h2>
                            <h5>Cellphone Privacy Update:</h5>
                            <p>This past June in one of its most important privacy rulings, the US Supreme Court
                                unanimously decided that police must first get a warrant in order to search personal
                                electronic devices such as cellphones. This monumental decision will help protect
                                privacy rights of Americans in the digital age. However, this does not mean that the
                                police cannot search your cellphone, it just means that if you don’t give permission
                                they have to get a warrant. If the police want to search your cellphone, it’s probably a
                                good idea to refuse and immediately call a lawyer for assistance on how to handle the
                                situation.
                            </p>
                            <p>Furthermore, as we approach the 50th anniversary of the “Miranda Warning” which has been
                                ingrained into our culture in countless TV shows and movies (yet so many people ignore
                                or forget this right), it bears repeating that if you are being questioned by the police
                                you should immediately tell them that you want to speak with a lawyer and then remain
                                silent. Best idea – no matter how hard it may be - just keep quiet.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Estate Planning and Inherited IRA’s Update:</h5>
                            <p>In another unanimous US Supreme Court ruling, it was decided that inherited Individual
                                Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are not shielded from creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.
                                Retirement accounts such as an IRA are usually protected from creditors. However, under
                                this ruling if you are the recipient of an inherited IRA that money is no longer
                                protected from your creditors. This is an important reminder that when it comes to
                                estate planning it is critical that you do not solely focus on your own financial
                                situation, but should also consider the financial situation of your potential heirs.
                                Sometimes tough questions and discussions involving family and friends regarding
                                finances are necessary so that an effective plan can be put into place. Estate planning
                                cannot be done in a vacuum and needs to involve looking at the “big picture” of everyone
                                who is involved.</p>

                            <h5>Driver Alert:</h5>
                            <p>There is an increasing “crackdown” on texting while driving by law enforcement as they
                                seek to change the thinking of drivers. According to the Buffalo News, the number of
                                texting while driving tickets has increased 82% in the past year. Many local prosecutors
                                and judges simply refuse to plea bargain these tickets down to parking tickets as can
                                often be done in local courts for regular speeding tickets. For a first time offender,
                                the fine for texting while driving can be as high as $150 (not including a nearly $100
                                state surcharge) as well as receiving 5 points on your drivers license. These penalties
                                are more severe than what faces the speedster going 20 mph over the speed limit. For new
                                drivers who have a probationary license, conviction now means an automatic 120-day
                                license suspension.
                            </p>
                            <p>After our very severe winter, it seems like potholes are everywhere. Now that we have
                                entered the month of May, NYS is now possibly back on the hook for damage caused to
                                vehicles on state roads such as the 90 or 33. As has been documented in the New York
                                Times and on local TV stations, NYS conveniently exempts itself from liability for
                                pothole damage under Section 58 of the Highway law except for the time period between
                                May 1st and November 15th - which means NYS is off the hook during the critical winter
                                months. For our local and county roads, potential liability only attaches if the proper
                                government is put on notice - which often means it must be done in writing and then they
                                must be given “reasonable” time to fix the pothole which can be as long as two weeks. To
                                report potholes on NYS roads call 1-800-pothole and for local roads call your town
                                highway supervisor.

                            <h5>Estate Planning Alert:</h5>
                            <p>As part of the recently enacted NYS Budget, the NYS estate tax exemption level is going
                                to increase to match the Federal level changes that were described in my Fall 2013
                                Update- though they will be phased in over the next five years. The exemption has
                                immediately been increased to $2 million, and will increase to approximately $3.1
                                million in 2015, $4.2 million in 2016, $5.25 million in 2017 and then match the Federal
                                level and increase with inflation starting in 2019. This important change in exemption
                                amounts will mean that for all practical purposes most New Yorkers will no longer face
                                an estate tax bill. However, while the changes are phased in, there are some significant
                                issues with the legislation that will potentially cause trouble (and significant tax
                                bills) for those whose estates are over $1 million - given the complexities involved,
                                those who find themselves “lucky” enough to be in such a position should seek out proper
                                legal and financial planning advice. For those estates above the exemption amount, the
                                top estate tax rate remains at 16% for NYS and 40% at the Federal level.</p>

                            <h5>Gun Owner & Hunter Alert:</h5>
                            <p>The April 15th deadline under the SAFE ACT for registration of assault weapons has now
                                passed, which means failure to register could result in misdemeanor and in some cases
                                felony charges for failure to comply as well as forfeiture of the weapon. In lieu of
                                registering, a gun owner has the option of modifying the weapon so that the now banned
                                military style features are permanently inoperable. While the SAFE ACT is controversial
                                and continues to face numerous court challenges, it is advised that gun owners follow
                                the law because the penalties for non-compliance are severe. As stated in my Fall 2013
                                Update, lawful gun owners need to be extremely careful to not be entrapped by the
                                provision that allows only 7 rounds to be loaded into a magazine. Furthermore, it should
                                be noted that under the SAFE ACT, it is now required that every firearm, shotgun and
                                rifle owned by a decedent be listed in the inventory of assets filed with the Surrogate
                                Court as part of the probate process. Finally, cross bow hunting will now be legal in
                                NYS starting this Fall once the DEC finalizes regulations.

                            <h5>Homeowner Alert:</h5>
                            <p>New York State’s 2013-2014 budget requires that ALL homeowners re-register for the Basic
                                STAR exemption. In the past, once you had registered for STAR you didn’t have to do
                                anything more, however, to help combat fraud where people were claiming exemptions on
                                more than one property (you can only claim it on your primary residence), New York State
                                is now creating a master database to stop the double dippers, which is why everyone must
                                now re-register. You must register by no later than December 31st of this year. The tax
                                department has mailed out notices to all homeowners, but they have been largely ignored
                                according to media reports. Given that the average STAR savings statewide is $700, many
                                people could be facing significant tax hikes next year if they don’t re-register. You
                                can register online at <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov"
                                                          target="_blank">www.tax.ny.gov</a> or by
                                calling the tax department directly at 518-457-2036. In either method, you will be
                                required to provide some basic information such as social security number, confirm that
                                the property is your primary residence and that your combined income is less than
                                $500,000. **This does not affect Enhanced STAR, which is handled separately by the local
                                assessor’s office and already requires an annual verification of age and income status.

                            <h5>Gun owner Alert:</h5>
                            <p>There has been much media attention this year on Governor Cuomo’s controversial SAFE Act
                                which imposes numerous new rules and regulations on gun owners and the gun industry in
                                New York State. While the court system deals with the countless constitutional issues
                                related to this legislation, lawful gun owners need to be extremely careful to not be
                                entrapped by the provision that allows only 7 rounds to be loaded into a magazine. There
                                is no such thing as a 7 round magazine, so gun owners must remember to only place 7
                                rounds in their regular 10 round magazine or face the possibility of being charged under
                                the act, which could potentially carry a prison term if convicted. While many law
                                enforcement agencies and local governments have condemned the law, you do not want to
                                risk a possible prison sentence as many law enforcement agencies (such as Lockport
                                police) have already arrested and charged people under this act for having too many
                                bullets in their otherwise legal gun. Lawful gun owners seeking more information on the
                                SAFE Act and its numerous provisions should visit <a href="http://scopeny.org"
                                                                                     target="_blank">http://scopeny.org</a>

                            <h5>Estate Planning Alert:</h5>
                            <p>While we can never know for sure what Congress is going to do, it appears that the estate
                                tax issue has been resolved at the federal level for the time being. Over the last
                                several years, the estate tax level has ranged from $1 million to being totally repealed
                                in 2010. It appears that the new exemption level will remain at $5 million, while being
                                indexed for inflation and allowing portability, which means that a married couple can
                                shield more than $10 million in assets. However, the exemption remains at just $1
                                million in New York State, with the tax rate ranging from 5% to 16%. Therefore, if you
                                believe your estate will be greater than $1 million you should seriously think about
                                appropriate planning if you want to avoid estate tax issues. Furthermore, when thinking
                                about estate planning, you also need to consider something that has long been overlooked
                                – your digital assets – things such as iTunes or Snapfish photo accounts, frequent flyer
                                or credit card reward accounts and even blogs – which can have significant sentimental
                                value as well as financial. The law is evolving with technology, but right now its best
                                that you make sure your loved ones know your passwords to such accounts, so they can
                                easily access and transfer them upon death because some “terms of service” agreements do
                                not allow them to be inherited and accounts are sometimes even terminated or “locked”
                                when a service provider is notified that the account holder has passed away.
